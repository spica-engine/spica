# Composer

## Important: Composer module is still under active development.

The purpose of composer module is giving users to upload their own front end components and use them with data they have in harmony. Once you upload your components to NPM, you can import your components into your project. If your components have dependencies to another package from NPM, you can import other 3rd party libraries as well.

Everything in composer module has been designed for decreasing cost and time. This is why adding a component is just two clicks in composer module. You can make your front-end development even with a phone or tablet.

When you create a page with composer, the system will generate a file. All HTML, typescript, css codes will be generated automatically with using your own components by the system. 

Once you save your changes, real file will be updated. Until then, all changes will be made in memory. You can create multiple pages and create whole frontend in composer. Links will be handled by composer. 

In composer module, you need to define a name, short name and a favicon. These names and favicons will be used for PWA builds as well. Spica makes splash screen images automatically from favicon image.

## PWA, Mobile Applications, Web Apps

Once you finish your front end, you can build it as mobile application and web application as well. Web applications will be exported as PWA automatically. The only thing that you need to do is giving an Application name for PWA builds.

## Fonts, Colors

To change fonts and colors, we provide built-in theming structure in composer module. So you can choose built-in color palette or you can make your own color palette. Also once you choose your color palette, you can update colors. 

Most of popular fonts are in system already. Also you can import any font family from Google Fonts easily. 

## 3rd Parties

You can import 3rd party libraries (named as collection) and also you can apply custom JS code. This custom code will be injected inside HTML head tags. 

> NOTE: Injecting code is very dangerous if you don’t know how to coding. We don’t do any check on custom injected codes.

For further details read API references and Guide documents.
