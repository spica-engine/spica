# Subscription (Webhooks)

Sometimes you need to set a trigger for a 3rd party application or for your own system. For this case we provide subscription system.
This system works with other modules in harmony. You will see subscriptions in “Developer Area”.
There are different types of trigger settings such as database trigger, http trigger .etc.
Each subscriptions have their own logs. So you can see when the particular subscription has been triggered and what data has been sent.
You can also send a bucket entry data to your subscription url.

Some examples you can to set a subscription are;

- You want to get notified each time when there is a new entry in specific bucket.
- You want to get notified each time when there is a change in an entry in specific bucket.
