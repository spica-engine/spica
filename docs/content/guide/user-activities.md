## User Activity Logs

User Activity module gives you access to control each passport identities' activity logs. You can filter actrivity logs by identity, action type, module, date or even document id. In a standart build of Spica, you can see all user activies without any time limitation.

> HINT: Because of no time limit on user activity logs, we suggest you clear user activities in a time interval. To accomplish this, you can create a function that clears the activity collection on a regular basis by using the **Schedule** trigger.

To list all Spica users' activity, simply navigate to **Primary** -> **User Activities**
